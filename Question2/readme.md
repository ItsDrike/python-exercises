## Even Fibonacci numbers
You should be familiar with fibonacci sequence, if not, look at the definition.
You are supposed to generate an output of fibonacci sequence between **1 and 10,000** including, but you should only use **even** numbers
### Definition:
Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.<br>
Fibonacci sequence: **(0,) 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...**<br>
If you are completly unfamiliar with fibonacci's sequence, you can take a look at this [picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#/media/File:34*21-FibonacciBlocks.png "Fibonacci numbers picture")
### Basically:
* You create a program that will give you fibonacci numbers from 1 to 10,000.
* You remove the odd numbers from this sequence.
* You print this sequence in 1 line separated by comma followed by space.

### Example:
There is no input, you only output the even fibonacci numbers.
<pre>OUT: 2, 8, 34, 144, ...</pre>
// You should get 7 even fibonacci numbers in range between 1 and 10,000
