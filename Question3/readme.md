### Caesar Cipher.
Basicly, caesar cipher is a very simple encryption method.<br>
Each letter of plaintext is replaced by a letter some number of positions down the alphabet.<br>
#### Example:
Left Rotation of 3 places:<br>
<pre>Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
</pre>
### Your Task:
Your task is to create a program, that will take plaintext as input and return ciphertext as output
You will use **Right Rotation of 4 places**.
#### Example:
<pre>IN: A
OUT: E
</pre>
