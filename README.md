# These are some Python code examples, that should improve your skills in python

## There are multiple questions, in each of them, you'll be given a task to create a python program
###  In every question, you'll be provided with
  * **readme.md** - file (this contains the question)
  * **hint.md** - hints, that can help you solve this problem (there can be multiple hint files (hint1.md, hint2.md, ...))
  * **Algorithm-text.md** - this is pretty much a solution, but it is written in text form, so you still have to write the code, but you'll just follow the algorithm
  * **Solution.py** - this is the final solution, it is a fully functional version of the program, that you were supposed to create
  * **test_Solution.py** - this is a test for solution, if you've created your own solution, you can try running this test on it, so that you can see if it has any errors and if it does, it should be easier to do the debugging; it is designed for *pytest* module

### Questions will be getting harder and harder over time, but it is meant mainly for advanced-beginners, so it won't be that hard, though some Questions can be quite hard.

## Good luck.

## - This is still a WIP project, I will add a lot more questions but I wanted to put it out, so anyone can try it, even with only few questions.
