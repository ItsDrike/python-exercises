# These are some Python code examples, that should improve skills of beginners in python (not only for beginners, there are some hard ones too)

## There are multiple questions, in each of them, you'll be given a task to create a python program
###  In every question, you'll be provided with
  * *readme.md* - file (this contains the question)
  * *hint.md* - hints, that can help you solve this problem (there can be multiple hint files (hint1.md, hint2.md, ...))
  * *Algorithm-text.md* - this is pretty much a solution, but it is written in text form, so you still have to write the code, but you'll just follow the algorithm
  * *Solution.py* - this is the final solution, it is a fully functional version of the program, that you were supposed to create

### Questions will be getting harder and harder over time, but it is meant mainly for beginners, so it won't be that hard, though some Questions can be quite hard.

## Good luck.
