# Python Exercises
This repository contains some coding challenges designed to improve your coding skills.
The repository is mainly designed for python programming, but feel free to use any other language you want.

Questions will be getting harder over time, it is meant mainly for advanced-beginners, so the questions won't be that hard, though some Questions can be challenging.

## Question layout
There are multiple questions, each named **Question***N* (N is Question number), in each of them, you'll be given a task to create a specific python program according to given instructions.

Every question will contain:
 * **readme.md** - contains the question
 * **hint.md** - hints, that can help you solve this problem (there can be multiple hint files (hint1.md, hint2.md, ...))
 * **Algorithm-text.md** - this is pretty much a solution, but it is written in text form, so you still have to write the code, but you'll just follow the algorithm
 * **Solution.py** - this is the final solution, it is a fully functional version of the program, that you were supposed to create
 * **test_Solution.py** - this is a test for solution, if you've created your own solution, you can try running this test on it, so that you can see if it has any errors and if it does, it should be easier to do the debugging; it is designed for *pytest* module

## Good luck.
