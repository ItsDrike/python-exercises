# This is a python test for begginers, to improve their skills in python

## There are multiple questions, in each of them, you'll be given a task to create a python program
###  In every question, you'll be provided with
* 1. *readme.md* - file (this contains the question)
* 2. *hint.md* - hints, that can help you solve this problem (there can be multiple hint files (hint1.md, hint2.md, ...))
* 3. *Algorithm-text.md* - this is pretty much a solution, but it is written in text form, so you still have to write the code, but you'll just follow the algorithm
* 4. *Solution.py* - this is final solution, it is fully functional version of program, that you was supposed to create

## Good luck.
